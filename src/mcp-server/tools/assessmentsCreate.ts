  description: `Assess identifiers for a signup or gateway decision.

Assesses one signup, login or purchase (flow) and answers with the account's one current risk: account.risk.decision is the decision for this flow (allow, step_up, review or block, where block means your block threshold was reached), and detail holds this assessment's own facts. depth sets how long the answer waits for sources: quick waits only for the fast ones (500 ms), full for the whole budget (3000 ms at most); it defaults to full for signup and purchase and quick for login. 200 carries complete or partial, 202 carries pending with Location and Retry-After. While the account's first assessment is pending, account is absent: apply your own fallback for that, 429, 503 or a timeout. NoResponse blocks nothing itself; you decide. Requires the assess scope. Idempotency-Key is optional in the SDK and is bound to the body for 24 hours: the same key with the same body replays the latest assessment with Idempotent-Replayed: true and starts no new work; the same key with a different body answers 409 idempotency_key_reused. response_mode defaults to standard; detailed needs the detailed scope.`,
